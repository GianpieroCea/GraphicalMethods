The code is to be run with R. This was tested with R version 3.4.2 (2017-09-28) -- "Short Summer" but it should be compatible with
most versions of R.

The initial part of the code should also take care of installing and loading all the R packages required. 
Here is a complete list of them:

-mlbench
-Amelia
-bnlearn
-BDgraph
-corrplot
-caret

In case any of the installation is unsuccessful, please look at the each documentation for further guidance on installing 
the packages.
